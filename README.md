# Chunkers

## Future
I need to do the following..

- Implement Reconstruction for Fortran
- Implement Repo Level outputting
- Check consistency of Metadata, standardize and improve

## Next Languages

### zig language
this wouldn't be too difficult to do

### cobol language
this wouldn't be too difficult to do

### c
would need some work

### Ada, Modula2, Modula 3, Algol60, Algol68, Object Pascal, Delphi
Using the Pascal Chunker as the base, we should be able to quickly create new chunkers for the languages above
